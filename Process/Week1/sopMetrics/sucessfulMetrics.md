**<u>Outcomes should be:</u>**

- **Park Attractiveness and Park Market Area**

  1. Use related information (facilities and others) to construct the park attractiveness metric

  2. Use Huff model to calculate the market area, and compare it with existing community service area
 
  3. Use safegraph usage data and others to predict the future usage in temporal and spatial granularity

- **Citizens' Usage**

  *whether the granularity is park or activity should be decided in the modeling process*

  2. Use safegraph data to understand the users (origin, demography, temporal pattern, and activity interests)

- **Staff Allocations**

  1. Use market area predictions to give suggestions about allocate staff resources

     (who should be sent to where and when)

     

**<u>What is the successful criteria for this project? Metrics?</u>** 

- Park Attractiveness Metric **increases**
-  Citizens' Usage Metric **increases** (in park level and in program level)
