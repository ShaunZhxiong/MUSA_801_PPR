**Parks**

You state your use case in various ways at various times - you need to drill it down and establish it.
 Use case help allocate programming at facilities using "new and interesting data"
 Be a bit more specific out of the gate on use case - more detail, animate the user.
 Why do we need to do this?
 Visual language is good, but they probably have their own language, so let's not say we are creating one for them.
 "how do we efficiently allocate these staff members.... and change up the prgramming"
 You have to pick one or make it clear how those are the same thing..
 "How do we make smarter decisions about how to program..."
 The safegraph data set - you need to link it more clearly in your messaging to how it's useful
 e.g. Status quo data are very minimal, we don't know much about who and how many people are coming
 Parks data set - you should explain these data and where they come from.
 How do they compliment the safegraph data? Are they at odds?
 WHat does PPR need to know to program their parks better - better allocate staff - I don't get this
 information until the end.
 What do we mean by "conflicts" between visits and activities? - let's drill down on this more clearly,
 that's a crux of this resource allocation need.
 We have a bit too much information on certain slides - if you can't talk to a piece of info, think about removing it.
 Talk through the charts and graphs
 I really appreciate these case studies - what are we learning about the opportunities and drawbacks of using safegraph
 data for these uses?
 Perhaps there is an opportunity for some supervized classification schemes - can we cluster these parks into various types
 based on programming and facility info?
 I love that you are doing deep research into these parks, it makes this a very rich analysis, we have to reduce
 the overall amount of data and info to make the pace of the presentation a bit slower.
 Next week I want to see some conceptual ideas about your modeling approaches, and some ideas about
 the various subsets of parks/programs as categories
